## Hardware Used

- Board: STM32 Blackpill (STM32F401)
- ADC Input: PA0
- Timer: TIM2
- UART: USART2 (PA2 – TX, PA3 – RX)
- Baud Rate: 115200
- Terminal: PuTTY

---

## Software Approach

- Bare-metal register-level programming
- Timer-based hardware triggering (no software delays)
- DMA-based ADC data transfer
- Interrupt-driven UART communication

This approach ensures precise timing, reduced CPU load, and efficient peripheral
operation.

## Expected Output

The ADC values are transmitted at 100 Hz and displayed on the serial terminal:
